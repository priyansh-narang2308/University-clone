                <p>It's pretty good. Majority of people who have given bad reviews are people who joined Amrita but also wanted â€˜the college life' and frankly Amrita doesn't have a lot of college life as in you cannot enjoy as much as you can enjoy in other universities. But apart from that the placements are way better compared to VIT,SRM or Manipal.</p>
